						<h2>Eden (Robotics Library)</h2>
						<p>
							Eden is a multi-platform repo used to interface with the KIPR Botball platform. Adam is a sub-branch, and the basis for Eve. Eve is an extension of adam,
							that offers the same functionality but with a roomba. My pride and joy, this repo has taken the most time out of my life compared to all other programs ive made. 
							It was the reason i started learning github (hence the frankley horrible push and pull practices early on) and its over a year in the making. It's also a walk through memory 
							lane, as the first time i had programmed in C (and C++) you see my code become more sophisticated as time goes on. Unforutunately, it does start on V4.0, earlier versions were 
							stored on replit, which doesnt have a history.

						<h2>PyTurtle Dragon</h2>
						<p>
							This was meant to be a simple assignment, draw a dragon in Python using Turtle (a lot of animals there huh)
							, but ever the over achiever i decided to make a very crude parametric graphing calculator and map out a ton
							of bezier curves. I probably couldve wrote something to get those coordinates, i mean they werent very far off
							from a .svg file, but it was very late and i was not thinking very well. This terrible graphing calculator did
							pave the way for my next project though.

						<h2>Turtle Graphing Calculator</h2>
						<p>
							This is a graphing calculator made in python, im hoping to really optimize it and use it in a paper im writing. every other graphing calculator ive used
							is slow (which i still suffer from. turtle is, yknow, a turtle. im getting there i suppose.) or doesnt have the functionality i need unfortunately.

						<h2>Normal Polygon Generator</h2>
						<p>
							A short little program in Vex Vr that takes 2 parameters, sides and size, and makes the shape for you. One of my first programs in the language, and 
							hopefully one of my last. I have a great disdain for block programming, i understand it has its uses but its so restricting. not to mention after 
							working with it for years in middle school, it gets boring after a while. i know not all block languages are the same, but they all feel the same. I digress, 
							I love bringing art math and robotics together in one cohesive manner, and this is an alright example of it.  <br><br>
							No link for this one, lost the file, the only remnant is this singular screenshot.
