                <h2>Break is over ðŸ˜­</h2>
                <h3>Nov 27 - 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    I personally dont like thanksgiving all that much, hot take i know. food is great and all, but turkey is so flavorless. Turkey is to meat what flour is to seasoning. bland, boring, 
                    flavorless. Plus, im not one for celebrating genocide, but thats a topic for another time. The important thing is that i started this website because i needed to make <i>a</i> website 
                    for my robotics class. (i still dont understand that, what do robots have to do with websites? i get that they would communicate over wifi but like.. not html. ill think on it.) i do NOT 
                    like google sites. im not a huge fan of most of the google suite, but its free so i make do. but not this time! this time i thought "challenge yourself sam, learn 3-5 new languages for the 
                    sake of it, it'll be fun!" and i must say this is one hell of a learning curve. I have worked with barebones hardware interfaces my whole life, so going from that to this is like black magic 
                    to me. this is like going from binary punch cards to C, and it is DIFFICULT!!! maybe that's why we're learning web development. to expand my horizons. regardless i am WAY out of my comfort 
                    zone and i didnt even have to do this! im not gonna get a better grade for this! i might even get a worse one im still not all that great with animations and stuff so as of writing this 
                    website is ugly! but in all honesty im glad im doing this. it was a fun project for the break. I do find that one of the worst parts of knowing how to program is knowing how absolutely 
                    horrible a lot of apps are. for the longest time android wouldnt save the volume you set to individual bluetooth devices, so if you had really quiet headphones and really loud speakers you 
                    were constantly blowing out your eardrums. when i first encountered that, i wasnt all that bothered by it. i didnt know a thing about programming and i figured it wouldnt be a problem if 
                    it was an easy solution. people say ignorance is bliss, but i think that's only true when others are also ignorant. if everyone was super smart ignorance would not be bliss, it would 
                    probably suck. but most people are ignorant (no fault of theirs, its pretty hard to know things, especially when it costs 50 grand to go to college), so it is actually pretty nice to 
                    be ignorant.

                <p>
                    did you like my rhyme? only answer if yes. I figured out how to type &lt;br&gt; without breaking a line! Im beginning to get pretty fluent in HTML and CSS, so im pretty proud of 
                    myself! I did have to ask chatgpt how to put an emoji, because i figured there was no way it was by actually copy pasting the emoji. i figured that the 4 websites i went to just 
                    had an error that displayed the emoji and not the text that gets you an emoji, but now im thinking about how to type & lt; without making a less than sign. textception. when will 
                    i ever need to do this? no idea. but i like knowing things which means googling things, alot. by the way, its &amp;lt; but this leads me to "how can i type &amp;amp; without getting 
                    an ampersand?", to which the answer is &amp;amp;amp; ... just a very long string of amp amp amp. unfortunately this is getting confusing, so im gonna stop writing because i can barely 
                    read this. as a bonus for reading this much, here is my favorite emoji! ðŸ¤­

                <h2>Hey! you found my blog!</h2>
                <h3>Nov 23 - 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my first blog entry! pretty neat, huh? You may have noticed these are in order of newest to oldest. maybe in a couple years, itll take some scrolling to get here, and
                    the fact that you found this will be impressive. or maybe youre reading this pretty early on in this website's life, who knows. Im not sure what to say here in all honesty,
                    ive never had a blog before. ill probably talk about whatever progress ive made or what ive learned... maybe like a diary for comp sci and stuff. i suppose ill just feel
                    it out and go where the text takes me! if your'e wondering why this is so poorly typed... im doing this in Visual Studio. I am editting the raw html file right now. there is
                    ZERO spell check! (pretend i put a crying face emoji there i havent figured that out) <br>
                    I need to complain about how VS does line breaks but i cant actually type it or it just... is a line break. i suppose you can just inspect the file and it'll make sense.
                    how come every time i type <br> VS updates it to say <br /> with a slash like />, i dont want that lame ass slash there, its not the ending of a line break?? and its on the
                    wrong side of the text too! and then i gotta backspace it to make it normal because it pisses me off for no good reason. just extra work, and i dont know how to tell VS to stop.
                    this is just my life for the forseeable future. <br><br><br><br>
