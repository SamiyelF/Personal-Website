                        <p>
                            Hey! My name is Samiyel D Frazier, im a sophomore at Barstow highschool (15 y/o), a published author,
                            and the lead developer for my school's competitive robotics team. I'm interested in robotics,
                            programming, art, and math. Im an avid learner, and constantly looking for ways to improve
                            my work! Im always ready to learn or teach, and if you have any questions/advice feel free to
                            contact me below!
                        </p>

                        <h2>Experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ive been in competitive robotics for over half a decade (thats about a 3rd of my life for those
                            counting), and in that time ive learned so much. i was the sole programmer for a First Lego League
                            robotics team in the 5th grade, which lasted up until i had to quit due to Covid-19. At the same time,
                            I was also a member of honors band, playing trombone. I would play music for school wide events for
                            hours on end... i dont much regret leaving band. those conditions were absolutely inhumane; we sounded
                            good though! <br><br>
                            Once we started coming out of lockdown and school was in full swing, i had started highschool. as a
                            freshman, i joined Barstow High School's robotics club, which soon saw me as a core member of their
                            team. I was about 3 meetings late from being a founding member, but i wont say im something im not.
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, our first year was a bust. lots of technical difficulties and miscommunication lead to...
                            unfavorable results. But this year, we're doing much better. I've published my first paper to the GCER
                            archives (Global Conference on Educational Robotics), and im working on another!

                            Some of the things i hope to achieve this school year: <br>
                            <ul style=" text-align: left;">
                                <li>Publish at least 1 more paper, hopefully 2!</li>
                                <li>Get in contact with some professors to peer review said papers (reach out if you're interested please)</li>
                                <li>Raise almost 15 grand for a team-wide trip to North Carolina to compete in GCER! (Any donations are appreciated!)</li>
                                <li>Update to Eden V8.0, with some wifi capabilities and maybe some high level calculus to keep things running smooth</li>
                                <li>To be determined</li>
                            </ul>
